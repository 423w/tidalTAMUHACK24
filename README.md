# tidalTAMU Hackathon2024

This is my team's Drowsy Driving Detection Model for the 2024 Datathon at Texas A&M University.

Our goal was to create a way to alert drivers of their drowsiness and rewake them using a ML model. We also attempted to use Flask and JS to take live videos to eventually feed to our ML model.

I worked on the evalation function and development of ML model.
